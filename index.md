Whether you're developing for us or thinking about doing so, this guide is here to let you know how we work.  It describes our approach, covering the key aspects of modern software development that we've taken to heart, but
also how we apply those techniques to give confidence to our developers and to the end users of the awesome stuff we build.

> By hosting this document on github, we can facilitate changes and improvements over time in the form of pull requests.  Try it!  We'll listen to all constructive comments.


1. [Fearless Development](pages/fearless-development.html)
